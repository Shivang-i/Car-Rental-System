Car Rental System (Java OOP Project)
Overview
This is a console-based Car Rental System developed in Java to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
The system allows users to:

View available cars
Rent a car
Return a car
Calculate rental charges based on car type

The project showcases Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

OOP Concepts Demonstrated
Encapsulation-Private fields with getters/setters in Car and Customer
Inheritance-SUV, Sedan, Hatchback extend abstract Car class
Polymorphism-Overridden calculatePrice() method in subclasses
Abstraction-Car is abstract, forcing subclasses to implement calculatePrice()
